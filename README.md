## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Responsive workflow

### What I learned

While going through this challenge, I found out a few things that I previously didn't know about modern HTML and CSS:

1. You can center an element within a container by making the parent a grid and not giving any columns.

```html
<main class="container">
    <div class="recipe-wrapper">
      ...
    </div>
</main>
```
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus on the following things:

- Developing with responsive design from the start
- Getting comfortable using non-fixed sizing
